## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
chooseCRANmirror(graphics = getOption("menu.graphics"), ind = 79,
                 local.only = FALSE)

 BOOK1 <- read.csv("BOOK1.csv")

 View(BOOK1)
 
 summary(BOOK1)
 
 install.packages("vcd")
 
  mean(BOOK1$AGE)
 
    median(BOOK1$AGE)
  
     mode(BOOK1$AGE)
   
     install.packages("dplyr")
    library(dplyr)
    select(BOOK1, AGE:SERIES)
     filter(BOOK1, AGE==21)
     filter(BOOK1, SERIES==5)
     arrange(BOOK1, GENDER)
     

summary(BOOK1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(BOOK1$AGE,BOOK1$SERIES)
     plot(BOOK1$AGE,BOOK1$COMPLAINTS)
    ```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
